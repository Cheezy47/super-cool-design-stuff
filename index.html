  <h1>Writing Assignment #1</h1>
  <p>An example of a software that I use is Office 365. Developed by Microsoft, Office provides a variety of
    productivity applications suitable for everyone. Examples of some of their software include Word, PowerPoint, Excel,
    OneNote, OneDrive, and Teams. I believe every office application is the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.
    On the surface, every tool and function is neatly organized and readily accessible, however, after putting in minimal
    effort to learn the program, you are capable of utilizing every feature. Furthermore, the consistency and
    customization they offer is also top-notch, with more refined functions being released with each new version.</p>
  <p>Proper software design is crucial to keep users coming back. Some qualities of well-designed software include ease
    of use, reliability, and intuitiveness. If a program contains these fundamental properties, productivity and user
    satisfaction will be boosted. It is also important that software continues to be optimized gradually. Over time,
    an interface can become dated or not be as secure as it should be. If this is the case, then improvements must be
    made to reduce vulnerabilities and create a more efficient design.</p>

  <p>The requirements gathering stage is fundamental to the software development process. Within this stage, developers
    gather information from the client through several forms of media and statistics. Some of these methods include, interviews,
    surveys, brainstorming, observation of analytics, and study documentation. Next, developers will layout a clear and concise
    set of operations that the software must perform. These are often written as user stories and are created based on
    feedback from the clients. Finally, all the user stories are arranged into a requirements document where the information
    is easy to process.</p>
  <p>This stage is important to the software development process because the user is the number one priority. If developers
    can't understand the needs of the client and the problems within their software, people are going to stop using that
    software. This can lead to loss of revenue and increased costs, detrimenting the company.</p>
