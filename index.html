  <h1>Writing Assignment #1</h1>
  <p>An example of a software that I use is Office 365. Developed by Microsoft, Office provides a variety of
    productivity applications suitable for everyone. Examples of some of their software include Word, PowerPoint, Excel,
    OneNote, OneDrive, and Teams. I believe every office application is the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.
    On the surface, every tool and function is neatly organized and readily accessible, however, after putting in minimal
    effort to learn the program, you are capable of utilizing every feature. Furthermore, the consistency and
    customization they offer is also top-notch, with more refined functions being released with each new version.</p>
  <p>Proper software design is crucial to keep users coming back. Some qualities of well-designed software include ease
    of use, reliability, and intuitiveness. If a program contains these fundamental properties, productivity and user
    satisfaction will be boosted. It is also important that software continues to be optimized gradually. Over time,
    an interface can become dated or not be as secure as it should be. If this is the case, then improvements must be
    made to reduce vulnerabilities and create a more efficient design.</p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment #2</h1>
  <p>The requirements gathering stage is fundamental to the software development process. Within this stage, developers
    gather information from the client through several forms of media and statistics. Some of these methods include, interviews,
    surveys, brainstorming, observation of analytics, and study documentation. Next, developers will layout a clear and concise
    set of operations that the software must perform. These are often written as user stories and are created based on
    feedback from the clients. Finally, all the user stories are arranged into a requirements document where the information
    is easy to process.</p>
  <p>This stage is important to the software development process because the user is the number one priority. If developers
    can't understand the needs of the client and the problems within their software, people are going to stop using that
    software. This can lead to loss of revenue and increased costs, detrimenting the company.</p>
  <p>1. As a user, I want a file system so I can organize my notes</p>
  <p>2. As a user, I want to upload photos so they can complement my text</p>
  <p>3. As a user, I want a drawing function so I can write digital notes on my tablet</p>
  <p>4. As a user, I want an auto-correct function so spelling and grammatical mistakes will be flagged</p>
  <p>5. As a user, I want my work to auto-save periodically so none of my work is lost</p>

  <img align='center' src='data_analyst.jpg' hspace='20' vspace='20' width='300' alt='picture of Data Analyst'/>
  <p>The software product that I used for the first writing assignment was Office 365!</p>
  <p>Name: Thomas Smith</p>
  <p>Age: 28</p>
  <p>Location: Hamilton, Ontario</p>
  <p>Income: $96,000</p>
  <p>Education: Degree in Software Engineering</p>
  <p>Occupation Background: Tom has spent the last three years working at a small tech company. Recently, Tom has been promoted
    to the head of the data analytics department, where he leads a team of data analysts to improve the business's decision-making.
    Some of his primary responsibilities include gathering, organizing, and evaluating data to provide the company with logical
    solutions to its problems.</p>
  <p>Software Used: Several Office 365 apps are commonly used by Thomas. This includes Excel for data analysis, Outlook for
    communication, OneDrive to store past and present files, Teams for collaboration amongst coworkers, and OneNote to display notes
    for the business.</p>
  <p>Behaviours: Thomas Smith is often described as an intuitive thinker, willing to take on creative challenges and technological
    problems. He thrives in collaborative work environments, making him a highly team-oriented individual who is perfect for this role
    within the company. Additionally, Tom is very neat and organized, which helps him to complete his work with maximum efficiency.</p>
  <p>Interests: Some of his interests include chess, Python programming, painting, analyzing the stock market, cleaning, football,
    hockey, and cooking.</p>
  <p>Goals: Thomas has a wide range of goals that he wants to achieve within the company. The most important being an easier method
    of data visualization. As of now, sharing Excel spreadsheets via email has been the go-to for Tom and his coworkers; however, Tom
    wants to start using graphs for easier interpretation. Furthermore, Tom will also implement guidelines so that inputted info will
    be uniform across the company, allowing for more comprehensible data.</p>
  <p>Challenges: A significant challenge that Thomas has faced recently is lowered performance across Microsoft apps. With the company
    expanding, more datasets are being stored, resulting in a noticeable performance decrease while using apps with large file size.
    Moreover, there are several functions that are not capable of being automated. This diminishes company resources, taking a large number
    of people a long amount of time to complete easy tasks.</p>
  <p>Motivations: Some of Thomas' motivations stem from his love for organization and a job well done. Tom thrives in a clean workspace, and,
    as a data analyst, this is crucial so that the data can be easily interpreted. In addition, he also enjoys helping others and watching
    them develop. This makes his role as head of the data analytics department a perfect fit for him, as Tom is able to collaborate and
    share his knowledge with others.</p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment #4</h1>
  <p>Communication is fundamental to the software development process. Without effective communication, there wouldn't be a clear
    understanding of ideas among team members, users, and stakeholders. This would drastically affect each stage of the development process.
    For example, inefficient communication with the client can lead to different visions or missing requirements during the requirements
    gathering stage. Furthermore, if you and your team members don't collaborate during the design stage, it can lead to inconsistent
    design choices, failure to meet certain goals, and ultimately a product that doesn't meet user expectations. Some key elements of
    effective communication include, being empathetic of others ideas to understand what they envision for the product, being honest about
    certain ideas for the success of the product, and being mindful or paying proper attention to everyone.</p>
  <p>Back in grade eleven chemistry class, I was assigned a random group for a poster board project on insect repellant. As we started
    brainstorming, I was already set on my own ideas, and I wasn't very open about the suggestions made by everyone else because I thought I
    had the perfect plan. Looking back, I realize I should have been more flexible and open when approaching the situation. If I wasn't so
    fixated on my own vision, I could have appreciated the exceptional ideas that they had come up with and even built upon them with my own.
    This would have resulted in a more polished and stronger group presentation.</p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment #5</h1>
  <p>The tenth principle, continuous attention to technical excellence and good design, is fundamental when creating reliable software.
    By prioritizing code performance and quality at each iteration, both the development team and user will benefit from a more efficient
    product. The team will gain from the increased readability, quicker debugging, easier maintenance, and improved productivity, while
    the user receives an optimized system with reduced security risks, less troubleshooting, and smoother performance. In other words,
    focusing on both the production and cleanliness of your software will result in a well-structured product that meets user expectations.</p>
  <p>An example of this design principle that I encountered is the website Amazon. Over the four years that I've had my account, the online
    retailer has continued to improve upon their technology. Innovations in both their standard package delivery service as well as the new
    grocery delivery system push for technical excellence, all while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design. This remarkable attention to
    detail results in an easy-to-navigate system that keeps customers coming back. Another example of software that uses this design principle
    is RBC. A couple months ago I downloaded their online banking app for the first time and was immediately greeted with a simple yet
    intuitive user interface. Every function was clearly indicated and organized in an optimal manner, with graphs and other forms of data
    visualization to accompany it. The design made it easy to scroll through account details, transactions, e-transfers, and budgeting tools,
    all without feeling overwhelmed. This combination of cleanliness, technical excellence, and a user-friendly design leads to a seamless
    banking experience.</p>
