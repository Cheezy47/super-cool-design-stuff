  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>An example of a software that I use is Office 365. Developed by Microsoft, Office provides a variety of
    productivity applications suitable for everyone. Examples of some of their software include Word, PowerPoint, Excel,
    OneNote, OneDrive, and Teams. I believe every office application is the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.
    On the surface, every tool and function is neatly organized and readily accessible, however, by putting in minimal
    effort to learn the program, anything and everything is at your disposal. Furthermore, the consistency and customization
    they offer is also top-notch, with more refined features being released with every new version.</p>
  <p>Proper software design is crucial to keep users coming back. Some qualities of well-designed software include ease
    of use, reliability, and intuitiveness. If a program contains these fundamental properties, productivity and user
    satisfaction will be boosted. It is also important that software continues to be optimized over time. Gradually,
    an interface can become dated or lack proper security. If this is the case, then improvements must be made to
    reduce vulnerabilities and create a more efficient design.</p>
