  <h1>Writing Assignment #1</h1>
  <p>An example of a software that I use is Office 365. Developed by Microsoft, Office provides a variety of
    productivity applications suitable for everyone. Examples of some of their software include Word, PowerPoint, Excel,
    OneNote, OneDrive, and Teams. I believe every office application is the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity.
    On the surface, every tool and function is neatly organized and readily accessible, however, after putting in minimal
    effort to learn the program, you are capable of utilizing every feature. Furthermore, the consistency and
    customization they offer is also top-notch, with more refined functions being released with each new version.</p>
  <p>Proper software design is crucial to keep users coming back. Some qualities of well-designed software include ease
    of use, reliability, and intuitiveness. If a program contains these fundamental properties, productivity and user
    satisfaction will be boosted. It is also important that software continues to be optimized gradually. Over time,
    an interface can become dated or not be as secure as it should be. If this is the case, then improvements must be
    made to reduce vulnerabilities and create a more efficient design.</p>
